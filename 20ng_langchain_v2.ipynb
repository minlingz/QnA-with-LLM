       "[\"I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack of any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually, I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end to non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of fun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final regular season game.          PENS RULE!!!\",\n",
       " \"[stuff deleted]  Ok, here's the solution to your problem.  Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC),  BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).  I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two afternoon games.  Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.\",\n",
       " \"Yeah, it's the second one.  And I believe that price too.  I've been trying to get a good look at it on the Bruin-Sabre telecasts, and wow! does it ever look good.  Whoever did that paint job knew what they were doing.  And given Fuhr's play since he got it, I bet the Bruins are wishing he didn't have it:)\",\n",
       " \"I don't know the exact coverage in the states.  In Canada it is covered by TSN, so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage!  I don't know!  As for the picks Ottawa picks #1 which means it is almost 100% that Alexander Daigle will  go #1. He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec.  IMO I would take Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in the World Championships.  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team.  San Jose will then get Kariya.  Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov (I think that's it) or a      defenseman Rob Niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)  Because of expansion I won't go further but I will name other of the blue chip prospects     - Chris Gratton    - Chris Pridham    - a swedish player who I can't remember his name  Draft Order ----------- 1) Ottawa 2) San Jose 3) Tampa Bay 4) South Florida or Anahiem 5) South Florida or Anahiem 6) Hartford 7) Edmonton 8) Dallas 9) NY Rangers 10) Philadelphia  the 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong - I don't have the standings here and am guessing   (In my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft, with Kariya   leading the way but not going #1)\",\n",

       " 'I don\\'t buy this at all.  I think things are colored to a very large degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are.  Try this exercise:  XXX is pitching today.  His team scores 4 in the first inning, and 3 in the fourth.  XXX gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th.  In the fifth, he gives up 3 runs.  In the 6th, he gives up 2 more.  The score is now 7-5, with XXX\\'s team still on top.  I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be \"he is a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win.\"  If XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be \"he is an inexperienced rookie who doesn\\'t know how to pitch.  Needs more seasoning.  Send him to AAA.  Or to the spice rack.\"',\n",

Say for example, another team had this record : 20-37-47; they had 20*2+47*1+37*0=87 which is the same as their points total. (The Islanders' and Devils' records are both 40-37-7.

       " \"Well I think whenever ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job. But    what I don't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid    baseball news which is not important at all. Then I waited for the scores    to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and     football. Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid    basketball. Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that    was like 30 sec. I think they should give more attention to NHl during    the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..

Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville  before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the  majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he  became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation  as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to hit.

If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince, given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not a rosy picture.  BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation  coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

       " \"Was going over some videos last night.....  Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting.  And enlightening.  Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986.  1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk.  2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.  3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like     Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -     Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard     to make adjustments in your swing.  What would I do, if I were Jose?  Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.  First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely.  Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.  Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park.  If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could still hit 600+ HR.\",\n",
       " 'Well put, Jason.  I am not from Wisconsin, but I have close relatives who live in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee), I visit the city regularly, and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals play  and the NCAA Hockey Championships.  It is a beautiful building.  The Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in North America. As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a franchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown County Arena. Once again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of Milwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e. the Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights. Plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without the glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount of hockey interest exists in the city.

       " \"Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.  I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.  Chop Chop  Michael Mule'\",\n",

       " 'Right.  Most definitely.   This may be the root of the confusion...  Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind.  Note that I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand.  Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10 and win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week.  In the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population will win 7 or more times.  In the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again be 7-time winners.  In the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in each of the first two years will win 7 again.  Suppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three years, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last three years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.  Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game? No.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these \"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But suppose we *don\\'t* know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?  We can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the population will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a high positive correlation (even if they aren\\'t very good psychics, they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net result?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.   Well, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at the past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this* streak to be different from past streaks?  Now if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true to form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t have zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks remain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You look at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each way.   Then we would have something useful.  And we would also have a positive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses.',\n",

       " \"I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked, the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball?

       " \"Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter.   Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.  Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.  Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players with different strengths and a bright future.\",\n",

In the postseason, he sucked dirty canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more than *because of* him.   Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago, where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure of better. The concept is called \"context\", and you should really become familiar with it someday.   Unless this transaltes to \"Clemens hasn\\'t gone into Lou Gorman\\'s office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he\\'d been traded to the Jays,\" I\\'m at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.   What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of the games he\\'s started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17 wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens\\' career ERA. But I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it would have been a routine groundout, right?   Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.   No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.  Seriously, Roger, I\\'d really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher, and why? Did Morris somehow \"learn how to win\" in the intervening ten years? If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half a run lower than 1992?

A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie.  There also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other at a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a win.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10 ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.  So, Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then that\\'s what it means.

I do actually quote some things that Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as \"sampling\" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what I want to say.   There\\'s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people\\'s conception of a biological organism.  In the biology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of the game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is trickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\" interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case,  but that would be a different and probably longer post.  If, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we know about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious of such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map \"species X\" onto \\'humans\\', and \"organ Z\" onto \\'brain\\').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. \\'brain\\' above might be more reasonable than \\'pancreas\\' assuming no gross pathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).  Even when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another. (Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to particular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple organs.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.   One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of course, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation, but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.   In this cases, we\\'re seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of observed events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes. Thus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses.   This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again. Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment; you might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to baseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least a nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the league, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in biology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the World Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played, and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but it\\'s unclear what it all really means.  ***  Now just one more un-related point:   On the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis. But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops aren\\'t the only difference between the winners and the losers.  Moreover, you\\'ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World Series situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict the WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.   Since stats are summaries of events, it\\'s true that if you know the events you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new knowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and useful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledge in a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledge even though I\\'m relying on stats to do it.',\n",

       " 'I\\'m not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in a neutral park Bo\\'s HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"  One thing, when looking at Bo\\'s stats, is that you can see that KC took away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed,  hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.     Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park. I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player. Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.   I\\'d put him about there too.    Note: I hadn\\'t realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so  at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t winning.  Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a mistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).  We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction; the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc.  Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes a player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star. Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are real reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on.  But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.  What hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly?  It hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players. (It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton. \"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well, what happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville.    Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s.  But you guys DON\\'T KNOW.  What\\'s  worse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t.  And you don\\'t know that there are  other players you won\\'t know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties  again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It\\'s not. It\\'s got some error.  Oh well.  Bill Guilford',\n",

If it\\'s working, you don\\'t SCREW IT UP by changing things, just because you think it ought to be different.  Some folks like to argue about theoretical details. I prefer to watch teams win.

Until then, I think it\\'s stupid to focus on what\\'s wrong, for the simple fact that IT\\'S WORKING AS IT IS.   In the majors? I don\\'t follow AL, so I won\\'t comment on \"Majors\".

Williams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he isn\\'t headcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops to .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest Baseball Weekly, he\\'s hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296. That\\'s not exactly chopped liver.  Mostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that continues, it\\'s rather silly to second-guess their strategy.

He\\'s a little bit quiet at  the plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn\\'t think *anyone* could hit like that.

McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.

Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:  Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100     Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Here\\'s the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let\\'s say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \"Bure\" \"Konstantinov\" and \"Borshevshky\". Is this North America or isn\\'t it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \"Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I\\'m not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).       Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren\\'t even better hockey players. It\\'s all hype. This \"European mystique\" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.

If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)       without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base       as if walked.  This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases considerably.  Suppose the pitcher uses up (N-1) of his N pick-off attempts.  The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base, given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it right this time.

       " 'Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that\\'s OK, I understand you have a hockey background. Stats like \"plus/minus\" make RBI look good.   OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here\\'s a very simele question to which I\\'m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please answer yes or no, Roger:  Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs? AL only, please.  For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact that a team\\'s win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows. It\\'s not a definite, hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs, for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game. So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238 for Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in (particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola\\'s as better than Morris\\' in the sense that \"had Morris performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"   This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

But, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have  been a different story :-)  Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in Major League baseball ....  Pretty impressive in any league.  Man, if Johnson, Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a  really interesting team to follow this year.  Also, John Cummings (rookie) has had three solid outings with no support.  If Fleming comes back  this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year (relief is another story, though - grimace).  Too cool.  The first no-hitter that I have been able to follow from  start to end.  And again, I think Niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game.

       " 'I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he  had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.     Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: Morning show:   In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi,  and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12 Noon:   I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story.   I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host.  12 Noon to 2 PM:   At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to  Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability to transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia  spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan. Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\') I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and you can\\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.  2PM to 4PM:   This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and  Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which are often hilarious.    4 PM to 7 PM:   MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like Mike Missanelli but I just can\\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.   I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now.  I don\\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the  reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.  7 PM to Midnight:   S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show) On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets Jets, or St. John\\'s basketball.  If the game is on the west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season. (If this is the sports station, why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.)) During the summer, it is all talk on WIP.   Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.                   Rich',\n",

He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.  As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don\\'t believe there is), then wouldn\\'t you rather waste Lopez\\'s 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season?

The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he hadn\\'t done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him down \"until he gets warmed up\".   Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do with Javy Lopez?   See above.     But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most players aren\\'t that good, so they probably won\\'t be that good this year either.   And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.

The difference between Lopez\\'s bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, I\\'ll take the latter every time.   Just like Keith Mitchell did?   That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they really don\\'t understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience, or some combination of the two.

All Kjell could do, at 8\\'7\" and 355 pounds, was laugh!  And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting a little out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlands except for the officials could see last night, he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the Devil\\'s throat.  I\\'ve always supported the argument \"he does his job by being irritating,\" but he\\'s starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course, Holik\\'s chop to Barrasso\\'s neck wasn\\'t too sportsmanlike either. It seems that he was following the \"The only way to beat the Penguins is to injure them\" philosophy.

Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and neck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one had the better year can be considered a toss-up.

It seems to me that a first-baseman\\'s defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily) from his ability to field grounders or catch popups.  How many such chances does he get during a game?  Many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is much higher than Grounder/Popup totals).  This implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line or in the dirt.  \"Good Hands\" are needed for such plays, and thus have value.  I don\\'t have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays, but I\\'d guess that the values of these abilities are similar.

       " \"It was not just those penalties. Most of all it was the penalty the referee didn't call on the Czechs right before their first goal.   Don't you think it's quite silly to call it a Nazi attitude, when some people  throw coins on the ice? Hey, I don't approve the behavior of these guys, especially not in a WC game, but I can't see any reason for using the word 'Nazi' in this connection.      Soccer hooligans are not just a German problem (remember the world cup in Italy). Again: there's a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shop-windows or fighting with other so-called 'fans', who come to a WC just to see if the Dutch or the English or the Germans are the best bruisers. Which other sports are you talking about? I don't think soccer is 'every possible sport'.   How many Germans do you know? Do you think 200 out of 10000 is 'most of them'?  If you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the US, what do you think about the Americans? 'Most of them' like beating blacks?\",\n",

       " \"[more about the Messier-Samuelsson incident]  I agree with Rick that Ulf's cross check wasn't illegal. It was the kind  of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called. Slo-mos  sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are.  Besides, if Messier can't take the heat, he should stay out of the kitchen.   Well Matt, Mattias Timmander hasn't been playing with the MoDo elite league  team yet (just the MoDo junior team), so I predict he needs a few more years  here before he can join the B's. I saw him play in the Swedish championship  game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,  but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to  have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :)  As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in  division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,  and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is  considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is  Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play  in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course.  I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to  watch in Swedish hockey this season.   Staffan\",\n",

       " 'Here is a press release from the White House.   Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \"Black Bears\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                             The Rose Garden   9:58 A.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It\\'s an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we\\'re glad to have them here.       I\\'m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  I\\'m sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don\\'t have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It\\'s a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, there\\'s a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can\\'t imagine.  (Laughter.)  I\\'m actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think it\\'s important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and I\\'m glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE PRESIDENT:  That\\'s great.  I love it.  It\\'s beautiful. (Applause.)       (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)       THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That\\'s great.  (Applause.)                               * * * * * *       Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco this morning, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.       THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell, he\\'s worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we\\'re going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we\\'d get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don\\'t want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they\\'re taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don\\'t have much of a history on which to base their position.  They\\'ve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we\\'ve got a chance to work it out, and I\\'m hopeful. We\\'ll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I\\'m feeling pretty good about it.

I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.    I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch.    The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much.  I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse.

       " '1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes. -------------------------------- Playoffs: --------- *Stauber disturbed by third-man theme by Rick Sadowski, Daily News  Barry Melrose\\'s decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender.  \"I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most fun time of the year, and I\\'m not,\"  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  \"I think I have worked hard enough for that.\"  Stauber said he accepts Melrose\\'s choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays 6-3 opening victory.  But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.  Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was  yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.  Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic Saddledome popcorn.  \"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs.\"  Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.  While insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were, according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to  Vancouver on Thursday.  \"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a great goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"  \"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve got to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect more from him than he does.\"  Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the team hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.  \"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber, a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only  to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.  \"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"  \"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry  doesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m a perfectionist.\"  Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But  even though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s  a bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game  you\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67  and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\\'s what barry wanted me to explain  to him, why I didn\\'t come through when he counted on me.  I don\\'t know. What I  do know is, it\\'s a sport.  I\\'ll be there.\"  Melrose\\'s \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn\\'t mean much to Stauber. \"Before you know it, I\\'ll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.  ------  *Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC  Channel 7 here in LA.

The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season. Last season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted). This season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more at bats.  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better hitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been a better hitter in certain situations than Sabo.  I did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a hit.  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or even a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that situation than Sabo.    Ah.  \"properly\".  Yes.  I see.   Please help me.

Sorry.  But if you were interested in a reason why I expect Chris Sabo\\'s ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next, I think I could.  If you were interested in a reason why I expect Joe Carter\\'s ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next, I think I could.  But you\\'re not interested in that, because you think that those conclusions could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire baseball population.  And they can\\'t be.    The problem here is that I *do* believe you.  I accept your work. I believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based on prior clutch history is meaningless.  No better than a coin toss. I actually *do* accept your work.  As it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations, for certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in projecting future player performance.  For that player. And Chris Sabo is one such player.    Well, since I defer to your statistical wisdom, I think I must have an open mind.

That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year, but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.  I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.  If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.\",\n",

Anyone who would follow the Pens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are losers. It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home team. But to  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true fan.A  true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team.

In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.  He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't and wouldn't play a lick of defense.  It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has certainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it wouldn't matter.  If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.

       " \"The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period and the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium. Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead.  The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period.  Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.  Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.  Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net.  Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.  With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.  The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle.  Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.  The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league.

       " 'I like the Clark-WIlliams-Bonds order. Pitchers can only walk Clark with 2 outs (unlike last year).  Williams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds looming in the on-deck circle.  Since Matt has a terrible batting eye, this helps the Giants a lot.  When Bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2nd and then be driven in with a single by Thompson, Manwaring, or Clayton.  If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers, then you don\\'t want him to run because a \"caught stealing\" could take you out of a big inning.  Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double).

       " \"No, and in fact, that was Ferreira's original strategy, which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper, and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those injuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar.   Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly Kisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.

       " '\"Deeply rooted rivalry?\" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined the top flight only in the early \\'70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you\\'re exagerating here.   That\\'s a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they\\'ve had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I\\'m sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne\\'s ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland\\'s top five players (Winnipeg\\'s Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver\\'s Lumme, Los Angeles\\' Jari Kurri and New York\\'s Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There\\'s presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn\\'t be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa\\'s 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk isn\\'t completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won\\'t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton\\'s \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late \\'80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I\\'d settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.',\n",

After the way May played at the end of last year and the way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench? Not to mention that a right hander (Maddux) started. I really blew my top when Lefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS! How can you do that just because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. Wilkins is twice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, one of the weakest hitters I have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat all day, and Lefebre let him hit, while May still sat the bench. I think even Arnie Harris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout while Vizcaino was batting. Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in baseball. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA dishard Cub fan\",\n",

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.

Many of the rest, who have been playing with injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really rather be playing golf, don\\'t really give a damn.  Of course I can\\'t say this for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I don\\'t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically human attitudes.    With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing  money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff \"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are going to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the  game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make a decent living.   Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is  being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.  The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top  after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The  emphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the league over the year.  They proved it.  cordially, as always,  rm',\n",

Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary  supplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and the US will just maintain its slow increase.

The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the 7th for the other Tiger run.

Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.

Down the stretch, he : abused Jim Bunning, Chris Short, and Robin Roberts (I think those : are the three) pitching each on only 2 days rest for quite some : time.  By the time they hit the last 2 weeks of the season, : obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm.  Oh : well.  Roberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.

They were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two games after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory (Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the title; they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards, with the Giants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead against the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way tie.  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they scored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis. --\",\n",
       " '[some deletions]  Well, we agree on the last part.:-)  One of the basic things you need to  have in a statistic to be able to predict a player\\'s performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year.  A  player\\'s batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year. A player\\'s ability to walk or infielder\\'s Defensive Average are correlated better.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics we can have a pretty good handle on how they\\'ll do next year.  Put in  some simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of  the basic problems with something like \"clutch\" batting average - overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero.  Adding to the sample size doesn\\'t seem to help much.  As a counterexample to  what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:                 Non-Clutch                      Clutch                AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA   Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307 Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223  If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\" situations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in  1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon hit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of  completely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\" at bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple measure of clutchness, let\\'s just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use  \\'84-\\'87 to predict \\'88 for those 96 players, you\\'d find that 27 of the 96 were below league average in that measure both in \\'84-87 and in \\'88, 26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were  above in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins, you\\'d expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  The difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment is not statisically significant.  BTW, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with \\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at something better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their (clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of  0.088, significant at no level of any interest.   Actually, it\\'s technically incorrect to say that we can\\'t predict future clutch performance.  It\\'s more correct to say that we can\\'t predict future clutch performance with any skill.

A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as  getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd have two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also have two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are different.

       " '[stuff deleted]    The last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the playoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques Demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively, embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the  playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the Norris).  It\\'s true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before  Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*-- tougher division than the Norris, also known as the \"Snorris\", division. Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley Cup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such  powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force in the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was  everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.  Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good players, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the coaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.   There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn\\'t in as bad a shape standings wise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which I outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I\\'m sure everyone reading this will agree.    We\\'ll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final (assuming they don\\'t get knocked out, like last year).',\n",
       " \"I suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning.  An outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a lot of balls, preventing both singles and doubles, and also cut off more uncatchable balls, turinging doubles into singles.  However, a fielder who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies; this means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles.  Has anyone seen these players' positioning?  Do Butler and Felix play deep, and Lankford, Martinez, and Wilson shallow, or is this a park effect?  I thought Butler liked to play shallow.\",\n",

First Base:  Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations, then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs  Second Base:  Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge to Cubs...a big edge.  Shortstop:  Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an automatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.  Third Base:  Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter. Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to Florida.  Catcher:   Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to Marlins  Left Field:  Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential. I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.  Center:  Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May isn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays full time.  Right:  Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs  Starters:  Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs  Middle Relief:  Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins. Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.  Closer:  A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save. Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.

Yet you would pinch-hit Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and Sabo will be a choke hitter.  Right?  I\\'d call that \"predicting the future\".   Right.  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past.  Overall performance, L/R splits, even matching hitting/pitching styles.  All of these will give me some advantage if used properly.  EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance.  And in this case, everything else pointed to Sabo.   That comes down to the same thing.  When Perez left Sabo in, he was predicting the future, the next AB.  He was predicting that Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel.  By supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite.   Well, yes.  You are aware of its existance.  You claim to be incapable of understanding it (though I suspect you are simply unwilling).  Yet you rather forcefully state the opposite.  You don\\'t seem to think the work is worth reading (yet you obviously feel the topic is important). I\\'d say this is insulting.   RIGHT!  This is the beef.  It has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under *any* circumstances.  At least none that we\\'ve been able to come up with.  If you know of some where it *is* an indicator of future performance, please let us in on your secret.   Most certainly.  As I have repeatedly stated, if you can come up with a study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability, I would love it!  However the straightforward attempts at such a study have all failed miserably.   Well, it was a stupid argument.  (Are you honestly debating that???) Sure, we know Sabo didn\\'t get a hit.  We have no idea whether Samuel would have done any better or not.  One AB most certainly doesn\\'t prove anything!   Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year?  Or is this a prediction for *all* batters who have, over the past few years, hit (xxx amount?)  worse in the clutch than overall?  If you mean the first, then as you say, we\\'ll just have to wait and see.  But the second is a much stronger statement.  In fact, it suggests a rule.  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years.  I think you will agree that if the rule didn\\'t work last year or the year before, that it is unlikely to do any better this year.  Right?   I\\'m not going to get into case analysis.

From the raw stats, there is no way to tell which of a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders, and which were made on his own plays; likewise, you can't tell whether a double play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3.  Fielding Runs thus gives a first baseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and errors.    It thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently.  It also hurts first baseman who play behind left-handed pitching staffs and thus face few left-handed batters.   This is better; of course, it still isn't all of a first baseman's defense.   Defensive Average, which uses larger (and probably better) zones, has Mattingly tied for second in the league.

Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.   Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed. The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years.   Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first.   Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average.

       " 'Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football. Last year I hardly watched a game.  What turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game.  A team scores. 2.5 minutes of commercials.  Kickoff.  1.5 minutes of commercials. Three downs and a punt.  2 minutes of commercials.  AAAAARRRRGH!  Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A\\'s, whom I believe institutionalize slow play.  I don\\'t mind the cat-and-mouse game with Rickey on first;  in fact, I rather enjoy it.  Similarly I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first.  What I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first, or when the game is a blowout.  I don\\'t mind when the pitcher steps off  the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration.  What I object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity. When a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game.  When the delays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the commercial breaks in football.    I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to \"speed up\" the games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster.  That did not address the problem of the continuity of the game.  It may have appeased the sponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans.  Similary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch.  I doubt if anyone watching the Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out.  I doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball.  On the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games  out the way that they do.  I sure wouldn\\'t mind a little arm-twisting there.    --\\tThe Beastmaster',\n",

If he was as great a GM as you claim and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.

Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team\\'s top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games).',\n",

However, in this case, about the long-term financial viability of the Oilers, the fact is that Pocklington is basically  right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke the crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars in losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack of money.

No other business could ever get away with the 19th century  attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.  I guess the owners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessary to bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they don't realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they pay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game and its fans.\",\n",
       " 'We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris\\' contribu- tion  from the rest of the team\\'s.  There is only one way of determin- ing \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual\\'s  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.   Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.   You don\\'t have to be rude.   For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual\\'s  performance   from that of his team\\'s for the purpose of comparing that individual\\'s performance with another individual\\'s per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and  that\\'s  about  it.  There  is  no  new knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less  incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  --',\n",

       " \"Whoa.  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths is not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they are occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there  are any legitimate excuses.    I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result  in a goal.    In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as 'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second  goal.   What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the  game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final result is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy* goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.    WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times.   For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league.  In fact, I agree that he is.                               I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've made any other 'derogatory comments'.

Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!  It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game.   Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo,  Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark.

       " \"Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.  Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it? After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)  Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost, unless you're a franchise player.\",\n",

       " 'Having run completely out of time, I\\'ve got to get my prophesies and predictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year\\'s prediction contest.  AL East -- 1993  1.  Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this:   -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.   -- Can\\'t bring myself to pick the Yankees   -- Milwaukee was a fluke   -- Indians aren\\'t ready to contend   -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn\\'t get any better   -- Detroit\\'s pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\" \"But you don\\'t really think the Orioles will win, do you.\"  No.  As a matter of fact, I can\\'t see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \"You don\\'t really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?\"  No.  I\\'m basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \"Glenn Davis?  That\\'s insane\".  Yes.  So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be   the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.   (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize   the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can\\'t move Ripken out of the #3   spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction:  \"The Streak\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in   caught stealing.  2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American   League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner    factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far   behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to   win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction:  Mattingly won\\'t top a 700 OPS.  3.  Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie   power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.   Guzman.  Alomar. WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.   Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that\\'s *really* a bad sign).  No one in   the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And   have a losing record.  4.  Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can\\'t keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction:  Surhoff won\\'t finish the year at third.  5.  Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix   Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki\\'s ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.  6.  Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre   Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how   you will :->  7.  Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he\\'ll be a shortstop this year.   Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.   This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP. ObPrediction:  Cecil *won\\'t* lead the league in RBIs.  One more division to go.... --  Dale J.

The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop  pass at his own blue line, and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat  Tommy to the stick side. The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald  was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy  to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed  on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest  periods I've seen Sweden play this year.  Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many  times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial  save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal  from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way  to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a  nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4  just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of  the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole.   Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled  through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,  Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close  range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,  and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.

Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just  deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play  goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the  far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.  Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of  the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.  Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya  entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,  then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to  deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.  The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side  and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.    Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri  Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and  in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,  and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros  after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.   Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,  7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player  (among those Kariya with 1+6).

       " 'It seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar and then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers, kept harping about how they \"must have had a different view upstairs\" because it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who saw the replay, that the puck didn\\'t go in.  The referee originally  signalled no goal but the video replay \"judges\" initiated contact with the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is unheard of.  Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about the Leaf chances this year.  cordially, as always,  rm',\n",
       " \"From this account, it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal, Mike. Smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the back of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never had a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it.   It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of  their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the  goaltender, or whatever.  And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only say that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games. There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late in the third period of the 7th game of the second round. Everybody on the team has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.\",\n",

If you were Pat Burns what would you do?  Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage to pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic idea...  Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against  the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples skin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole. He used to be good at it.  We need him now.    Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit\\'s second line. I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night. These guys are the \"swing\" players for the Wings.  Last year they did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.   Score Gilmour score!

I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and out-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending or officiating.

       " 'Here is a summary of Don Cherry\\'s coach\\'s corner from April 18, 1993. It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec series.   Pre-game comments ----------------- Don\\'s pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team.  Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand.  Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty.\"  Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL.  From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals.  Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships.  Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold.  Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party\\'s over, Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer be a \\'country club\\'.... \"NY should be achamed of themselves... If they go in the tank with Adolf there, they\\'ll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs.\"   Rating ------ Nothing too special in this episode.

       " \"So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out the Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning, Kasper...   Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\n",

She has won an Emmy for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary (which I know from nothing but which sounds good).  She said that among other things, Berg was the  principal spy for the OSS (CIA's WWII precursor) spying on Axis atomic programs, because of his physics background and language skills.  She said that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland, and had  instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him). (I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb program, but I don't know how reliable this is.)  Unfortunately, NPR didn't mention any kind of a book she's writing -- I'd certainly buy it.  (In case you're wondering about baseball relevance, Berg was a longtime MLB backup catcher.  He was a member of an MLB All-Star team that toured Japan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few Americans, much less MLB players, who spoke Japanese. Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids, according to McCarthy.)\",\n",

The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period: \\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51 \\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period: \\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00 \\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09 \\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period: \\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp) \\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11 \\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime: \\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play: \\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies: \\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves) \\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

If you're interested, you can send him mail at:  att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK  The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.  I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them.

Ville Siren\\'s slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.  The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo  made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,  during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.  Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to  Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered  the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund   skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.  Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line  where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since  there was traffic in front, 4-3.  Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan  and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to  Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.  Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only  21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone   with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.  The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck  and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.  But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the  game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.   All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.  Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations.   Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-  Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.  Stillman good on defense.  Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner  hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson  will likely have to leave for NHL pros.   Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the  Finnish team.

       " \"To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three homer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the  Cards and the Yanks.  He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe Ruth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan Gonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that  he had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record books at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I  am wrong.   \\tOnto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I can't get McPaper consistently around here.   comment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could  hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.   leadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm  lucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals already.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this year is stealing bases. Sheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing. Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury, or anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything. Andy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is  this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone  seen him pitch the two good games? score for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep the Cardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.  Sheffield and Tueful also homer in a winning cause.   \\t\\t\\t\\tThanks for listening-reading \\t\\t\\t\\tany comments????\",\n",

As for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt. One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to give them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot for Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis' goals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player. Finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie, no way to stop the shot.  I congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.

His equivalent average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level of play.  That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave Winfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds, an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what Mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years; just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan Klesko's MLEs.   He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting. That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best hitter in the majors.\",\n",

And of course, they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.   Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an \"Americanization\" of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is \"American\" or not is irrelevant.

       " \"It was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff of nightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.      For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three games of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this time.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.    On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice advantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It wasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.    John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting goaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday. Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on the powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box. LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was Khmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and Hannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob Sweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of penalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get his first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied the game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime. Last year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet revenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a tip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime. Both teams finished with 34 shots.           Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.         Referee--Rob Shick.  Comments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic again.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea to Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was only five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no one took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview, noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was too loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't skate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each were out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he responed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than that, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he must not understand playoffs.  Uh-huh.\",\n",

Maybe Hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe it\\'s all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.  In three games. Why don\\'t we look at this one again in, say, July?  A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don\\'t forget that Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB\\'s last year. Beware of small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he\\'d be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he doesn\\'t have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.  Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the \"in the field\" part, and I think he\\'ll be better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he\\'ll be a pretty good hitter, couldn\\'t carry Boggs\\' jockstrap. With a little luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs, Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).   See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500 is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \"could run away with the division\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats. It\\'s not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If Russell does well, Darwin doesn\\'t go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn\\'t pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they\\'re too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he\\'s a lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to release Otto if he doesn\\'t turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW, Otto\\'s game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out a problem with the method since Otto\\'s performance was infinitely bad, and excruciatingly prolonged.)   I think Merced\\'s rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren\\'t you willing to give him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting so gloomy?   No he didn\\'t.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when the league finally realizes this, it won\\'t be pretty at all.   Don\\'t be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors. Meanwhile, I\\'m not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a six-year free agent before the 1992 season.   Twice through the rotation, and you\\'ve given up?  Yikes.   But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can\\'t be much longer than a year.   But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 1992.  I don\\'t think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign him.   He certainly wasn\\'t last year.   Hey, that\\'s the \"Skates Smith\" package deal.  Anybody who acquires Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is a real weirdo.   If that\\'s the goal of the team ownership, than I don\\'t see why Sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don\\'t know what he has or hasn\\'t said about revenue sharing, so I can\\'t comment there.   It\\'s annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons\\' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts, which means that even if fail it hasn\\'t done serious damage to the Bucs\\' future.   Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I never heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on this?   I\\'m not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don\\'t know who to blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.

       " 'Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday      Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \"What could be better,\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \"It\\'s pitching, it\\'s always been pitching that we\\'ve lacked,\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we\\'ll know we might be able to win.      \"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell\\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \"Teams are starting to realize that you don\\'t have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it\\'s a credit to the Phillies that they\\'ve been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\\' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday\\'s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren\\'t among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday\\'s game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \"We\\'re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don\\'t see why we can\\'t win this division.\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher\\'s park like this,\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets\\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn\\'t tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves\\' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\\'s doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the \\'61 Yankees\\' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves\\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff\\'s batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can\\'t afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t Davis will get decked once.\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \"It\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: \\'If I can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs\\',\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn\\'t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.      \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \"They\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We\\'ll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers\\' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \"We\\'re mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.

       " \"Ted, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla, on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.  If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion, that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.                                       -Sean\",\n",
       " 'I know it\\'s very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let\\'s give credit where credit is due.  It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris. Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the  other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can\\'t remember exactly). Also, let\\'s not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save  the bullpen every fifth day.  If he didn\\'t help us win the AL east, forget about the pennent and the world series.  His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer\\'s (5.90 runs) and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of 6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good as he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters \"get themseleves out\" (I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out  trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a  veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra (I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.  Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let\\'s not change history to suit the present.    BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a  veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more can he be embarrassed?   ditto!',\n",

       " 'writes...     Oh, probably.  Ms. Nichols has given the average game times (and average runs scored) for 1983 and 1992.  (A very nice piece of information, Ms. Nichols.  Who knows? She may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.)  Those numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* being scored per game, and the games taking 15 minutes *longer*.  Something is being done now that wasn\\'t done ten years ago, which is extending the games by 15 minutes.  Ms. Nichols thinks it\\'s more pitches.  Given the increasing specialization of pitchers, it wouldn\\'t surprise me.  If it\\'s not simply more pitches, though, I don\\'t think it\\'s unreasonable to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back.  Then I get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher after he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules, which have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones).  The problem is, who decides whether that time is \"wasted?\"  You don\\'t seem to think it is at all.  Right now, I think it is, although I have heard one case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (the difference in mounds between the field and pen) -- but who knows?  If the rules get changed, maybe something I didn\\'t foresee will happen to change my mind.  But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing, or else nothing will be changed.

The Habs dominated the game from the 5:00 mark of the first and then on.  The score should have been 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall (bastard!).  He's the reason the score was as close.  Habs winning goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd.  Roy had an OK game.  He made the first save (one way or another) and the defense was there to clear any rebounds.  This just in, ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT. YAHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

       " \"I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points. However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more.   IMHO  Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.  Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are (in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration.  Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.  Darrell Evans - No.  Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.  Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.   Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers). Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.   Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for him.   Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name.  Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately.  Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes.  So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.  Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L. Smith No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman  As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\",\n",

       " 'Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for Kansas City, you\\'ll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the 4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.   Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn\\'t quite accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing, which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which point he disclosed the injury. Since he didn\\'t disclose it, the Sharks and he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a no-no).  Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was hurt. I expect he\\'ll surface with another team at some point (probably another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a bad judgement call.     Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but hustle isn\\'t always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto\\'s neck and another wrapped around Otto\\'s stick arm. Otto casually turned around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter wasn\\'t there. Hustle can only cover size so far.  The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he\\'s gone for good (ditto HUbie McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me \"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto retirement, but I haven\\'t heard anything official. His only hope in hockey now is the Gulls.    Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn\\'t think he was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.   Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you wish they\\'d performed than how they actually performed.

I know I have trouble, since you don\\'t see the off-puck action. your views from home and my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)    Coffee. Coffey is with the Red Wings.    You? Nah...   He was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate to judge the talent too quickly.

       " \"And some comments, with some players deleted.   Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.

       " 'Let\\'s be careful here.  If players\\' performance was completely random in (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year. With two years worth of data, you\\'d have 1/4 of the players good each year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year. We have 96 players for 5 years (\\'84-\\'88).  Just flipping a coin, you\\'d expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year. This is what we actually get--  No. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5 Clutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3 Coin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3  Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random. If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition) that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping a coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from  the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good. In the four years (\\'84-\\'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch  situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two years.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and really horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process,  you\\'d expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).    Everything that\\'s been measured about clutch hitting over a period of years that could be used to predict any ability with any  proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the  caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein  probably never had a \"clutch\" AB against a left-handed pitcher, but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his  platoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced at casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into  studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the Elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better than flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth- coming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.

Well,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote control.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble upon a playoff hockey game...  ESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give ESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX-50 coverage and having Bill Clement at a Pittsburgh's TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis. Maybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings for Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion. Good move,ESPN!\",\n",

What do you propose, a worthless vote like they do in college football?  What a joke!   If I remember right, Brad Park was also involved in that trade.  He wasn't all that bad a hockey player.

Courtnall/Ranford for Andy Moog (Oilers).  A wash.  Moog is a good goaltender, Ranford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year, and Courtnall always seems to get his points.  Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall as a defensive liability?  Ken Linseman for Dave Poulin (Flyers) ++.  Any more questions?  Janney/Quintal for Adam Oates (Blues).  ++.  Janney is an enormous talent and a personable guy, the the Bruins play in Adam's Division.  Enough said?  So,even if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I don't remember who  else (Joe Zanussi?) trade as a double minus, Harry the Horse trader comes out on top.  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry, not in spite of him.  BTW, do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season.  I'll bet  they finish fourth or fifth in the Conference, behind any of the following: Pittsburgh, Quebec, Boston, Washington, Islanders.  Someone correct me if these five teams will not be in Montreal's conference.  In summary, things look bleak for the Habs, at least in the near future.  I suspect that the next team from La Belle Province to win the Cup will be that team that Lindros didn't want to play for.   --  Dan Lyddy    daniell@cory.berkeley.edu    University of California at Berkeley\",\n",

       " \"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.  Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    --\\tThe Beastmaster\",\n",
       " \": In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why? : Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does : Toronto have?  Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium). Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters. I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season.  I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of the platoon advantage).  Am I missing something here?\",\n",

       " \"I haven't seen anyone post this so I will do the honors.  Maine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game. Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away with it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game. LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.  LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards. The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game. LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second. Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.  Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won the game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie. The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark. They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by Paul Kariya.  The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also proved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU goalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by both.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.

That\\'s an entirely  different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman.  Unfortunately...    The \"largest computer networks in the world\" phrase is a definition of  the Internet, not a group as a whole that she claims to represent.

And just for my own curiosity I thought I\\'d look up the \"official\" definition of large in the dictionary.  It reads:  large - 1.  having more than usual power, capacity, or scope.             2.  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size.  Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them.  65 people may be up there,  thereby validating definition 2.  I would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large, which would give it a large scope.   Why would he be impressed with this unless it were \"large\"?

       " 'The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but Kevin Dineen\\'s 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win, 7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night.  Roster move:  Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-McGill  Tommy Soderstrom  Game Summary:  Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!  The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there...  Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists :-).  The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.  Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league didn\\'t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the Sabres another power play, but they couldn\\'t get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.  Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was Russ Farwell\\'s trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they\\'d do it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it\\'s Russ\\' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season. He feels that they\\'re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup. He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.  He\\'s very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable. Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus.  The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling through the slot. Fuhr didn\\'t know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.  Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was all over it.  The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln\\'t get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind\\'Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.  But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it. Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn\\'t even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks end for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.  Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking minor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly, but couldn\\'t get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended. Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major, 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.  The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.  The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles...  That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.  Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.  Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on, horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...  Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through, but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass, but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.  But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom\\'s 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4.  Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle. While Brind\\'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek\\'s glove side at 6:44.  Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19. The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind\\'Amour and Ledyard went after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season.  Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play.  Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves. The Sabres weren\\'t able to pull Hasek as time was running  out as the FLYERS wouldn\\'t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres. Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind\\'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo, and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game.  So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn\\'t been tested much in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night (unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don\\'t think so). The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker.  A couple misc notes:  Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.  In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award, but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.  The Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\" has looked over Tommy Soderstrom\\'s medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future.  Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year.

The guy on him was     doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall     to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for     holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about     hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player     had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,     Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that     really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,     on the resulting PP and     eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the     outcome of a game.      They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking     obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones. This has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat.

Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very  well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over  Bellows\\' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all  those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them. Hextall wasn\\'t particularly brilliant on those plays ...    Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.   I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn\\'t screened the whole night.  The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic, Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.

Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn\\'t as good an example as Nieves would have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous years (which I didn\\'t have access to).  The point remains, though; knowing a guy\\'s minor league history is as good as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.   The MLE is not a *projection*, it\\'s an *equivalence*.  It\\'s a \"this is how well he hit *last* year, in major league terms\" rating.  So, in essence, he has *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.   Did they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place and last place, but no more.   Sure; they didn\\'t have anyone better.  I suppose they might have gutted the farm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were really in contention.    If you\\'d read what I wrote, you\\'d be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to put any credence in spring training.  Quite the contrary; I said that Lopez hadn\\'t done anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training could interpret as \"failure\".

Jorgenson did nothing exceptional that I noticed.  Leius missed a ball I *think* Gagne would have reached; we will certainly miss Gag's glove this season.  He looked pretty good there.

Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.

I won\\'t claim to split hairs and say that we can really measure who was better, Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga, last year; the difference is too close to call. But Larkin and Lee? Clemens and Morris? The differences are too great there.  In your measure of the game, why should a team that has just won it all ever replace a single player? Since they are now clearly \"best\", how can they do better? Yet every team can always find someplace where they beleive they can improve the team; they can always find a player a little better than one they already have. (BTW, by my definitions, the \"best\" player is the one who does the most things to help his team win. I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.)  Baseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. It is absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success or failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in most cases.) Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe Carter, Robby Alomar, Tom Henke, Juan Guzman, John Olerud, et al. Clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as Herm Winninham, Luis Rivera, and Jeff Reardon.

I bought another (a Canadian) at the beginning of the next season,  and I still have it.  I also have an Easton, that a friend was getting rid  off, after giving up the game.  I find that Easton blades are easier to get,  but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable.  Watch out for  dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades.  In my  experiences, the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks,  but I've only ever broken one aluminum shaft.  I like aluminum sticks.  The blades are quickly changed, even on the bench  if you have to.  On the downside, the shaft won't break if you decide to  impale yourself on it :-)  Ciao, Mark S.\",\n",

But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next  season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg  and Naslund, so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for  personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind  of money they would receive in NHL.    Actually, Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two  spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers. It is Mats Sundin and  Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team, although in a late  stage of the tournament.

       " '1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports. ------------------------------------------------- Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93  The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of a non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.  Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries.  The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.  1st period:  1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in \\'his office\\', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.  Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert. Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period.  2nd period:  The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game.  1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.  2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.  3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.  4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.  Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.  3rd period: The Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.  5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.  Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.  5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.  Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the  Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at  8:19) took penalties.    5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near  point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.  6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.  At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames right out of the game.  On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing.  On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.  Notes: ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.  Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.  The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.  Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon  games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play over their last 9 games.  The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

It is NOT a quibble, then, to state that \"the media\" did not portray Canseco as being  lazy. If the other person chooses to so accuse him, after my post, that does not make it a quibble. And in fact, the media around here tend(ed) to play up his time in the wieght room. Hardly \"lazy\", and hardly a \"quibble\". Have you ever seen any \"mediot\" portray Canseco as \"lazy\"? Unconcerned with his fielding, yes. Lazy, no.   Well, Canseco has been involved in several felonies, including his high-speed record, carrying concealed fire-arms, and of course the domestic violence.  Clemens had a run-in at a bar. Canseco had that, as well, and in both cases, the coverage was relatively minimal.   Uh, if the only evidence offered is anecdotal, how can it be objected that the counter to it is also anecdotal?   Uh, yes, and I agree with your assesment of Boggs, rather specifically. However, you did say \"everybody who has ever won a batting title\" has been accused of selfishness. I have not ever, anywhere, heard this said of Puckett. Pendleton, either. Similarly, Brett, B Williams, and others.     There are others.

The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night.  (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)  Topics ------  Don\\'s Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.  Episode Summary ---------------  This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don\\'s tie. Don was pointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn, and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)  Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night\\'s games, because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter and Fuhr.  Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the \"greatest goalie\", and said that he\\'s winning the series against Boston all by himself. He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when Fuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised \"Don\\'t Trade Fuhr!\"  Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would be Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the trade, but Don feels Muckler\\'s been vindicated.  The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by too many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver game, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty. Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved, but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: \"Its sad what they\\'re doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.\"  Next, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto. People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke \"Wendy\" for not fighting. However, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.  This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how banning fighting leads to more high sticking: \"It\\'s like college hockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody. That\\'s why you\\'re seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you won\\'t drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made by people who don\\'t know what\\'s going on in hockey\".  The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out that he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip of Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was taught to \"play to win\", which differs from today\\'s idea of just letting kids have fun.  At then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach\\'s corner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like one of the chipmunks.

       " 'Kevin Mitchell\\'s sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated  pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over  New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started  with a solid single to right, moved to second on \"Bob\" Kelly\\'s infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson\\'s well-placed bunt--a  rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.  Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only  given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who  argued plate umpire Kellogg\\'s inside strike by \"drawing the line\" (really, he should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting tossed.  The Mets\\' fifth started with a Howard Johnson\\'s first-pitch homer.  Pugh must  have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent\\'s single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley\\'s grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:  Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly: Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh\\'s first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (Isn\\'t the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)  The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin\\'s ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.  Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonilla\\'s three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci\\'s season.  Bonilla ended up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a  week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three.

This game was  quite much similar to the first game Finland played  (against France). The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third period Juha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so. The second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoff behind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first point of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game- prize.

He believed one of two things: 1) Sabo was more likely than Samuel to get a hit OR 2) that more good would be done in the long run by leaving Sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome.  In fact you don't know what Perez had in mind when he left Sabo in.   In fact, I don't think anyone is claiming that they can predict the future, or any particular future event.  But we can believe that certain trends are due to a cause (whether or not we have identified the cause) and therefore will continue.   I think seeing insults in other people's opinions is kind of silly. After all, Mark didn't call you a total idiot, or call your work stupid, he simply stated that it didn't change his opinion on the  subject.   If player A hits better on Tuesdays and always has, and Mark believes that it might be an indication that he will hit on Tuesday better next season as well, would you respond the same way?  At some point you might admit that all variable might not be known to you (who knows what this guy does every Monday night?  Maybe he sees his sports shrink on Tuesday mornings, or has his Vitamin B shots Monday nights?)  But this is something that's true of one guy only.  It doesn't mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire league by days of the week, nor that there should be.  But it doesn't mean we can't make predictions based on that for that particular player.   I only see a prediction for one player here.  I don't see anything about ALL batters.   That's exactly what Mark is trying to do though.  Find hitters that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions for these hitters based on their past performance.   Huh?  What does gambler's fallacy have to do with anything? Whether you can know the reason for correlation or not, you can't deny that it has existent, you can only make an argument that you don't think it is likely to continue to exist because you can't see a reason for it to exist.   Someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate. The argument along the lines of star player with L/R splits will always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game (i.e. opposing manager will always bring in a AH pitcher to face him, where his manager will not pull him for a PH)   What about you?

       " \"You're right about the signal being strong. I live in West Philadelphia, and I can get FAN almost perfectly. It's a sports fans dream (especially if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's away at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica, then Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed Coleman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two seperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!   Like I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I want. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly sports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite AL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:  \\t1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike \\t  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an \\t  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem  \\t  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on \\t  Broad Street.

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops, British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here it\\'s hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it\\'s hard to find a kid without a pair of skates.  And before you say \"what does he know? He\\'s from California.\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia, a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational hockey for about 35 years.    Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended, cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.  By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\" areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City\\'s rink is in an industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley\\'s is near Ashby and Martin Luther King, Stockton\\'s is in Oak Park, Sacramento\\'s is in an older section of downtown (I forget the name of the street), Fresno\\'s is out on the edge of town, just west of 99.  Santa Rosa\\'s is a nice rink, but it\\'s in an older section of town. Dublin\\'s is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee.',\n",
       " \"I think that Grant Fuhr deserves more credit than that! While it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well, I still believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr, the series would now be tied 2-2. He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres. In both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres the chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2.  Even in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to indicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been for Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was) through the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open up the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game).  There is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the victory.   In my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as LaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get extraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev (compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense , IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton playing a regular shift afterall ;-) The difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog.

Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air, waving a big towel over his head.  He looked like a big jerk, especially when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole season.  The next day, Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's Jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started.  The stadium announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's jeep.  Bell really freaked out. I don't think Bell was to popular after that.

I thought that's why Gant was asking for the appeal to the 1st base umpire; he thought Hirschbeck had gotten checked-swing help from the wrong umpire.   After Hirschbeck called for the pitch, but before the pitch was thrown, Cox came onto the field.  It was obvious that he was trying to get time called before the pitch, but no one was watching.     Your listing pretty much agreed with what I saw, with the aforementioned addendums.  Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark.  Personally, I was amazed that Gant didn't get ejected.  But that's why Cox did; it's called protecting your players.  And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game, all I can say is that you'd be making baseball history.  Even in the worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators are ejected, not everyone who comes onto the field.  And I'd have to  say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game  than what the Braves did Fri. night.

       " \"- - I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton. - Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference - next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed - to concern the Oiler's future. - - Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement - with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference, - Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that - the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to - renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium. - - Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier, - but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington. - - As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly - supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market - team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems - that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans - than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if - the team does move, there is no place more deserving than - Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand - realignment scheme of Bettman? -    Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by the Opposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton.  The government said that Pock is going nowhere!    Why don't I believe the government?  Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to be Tory leader 9 years ago?\",\n",

How bad would the Red sox have been last year without him?  Can you say 92 Phillies?  I believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi great tenacity.  Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen, but Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc.\",\n",

       " 'This is certainly not the case.  There is no significant *ability* toi perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every time there is a game-winning hit.  The \"clutch pitching\" quoted above is something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should be expected to be a clutch pitcher.    Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points, standard deviation about 30).  There will be such hitters in any league, just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.  And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year, probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don\\'t see any reason to pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past.  But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit. Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of Sabo\\'s clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)  Do you have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run?  Do you have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves?',\n",
       " \"The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as Vancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2. \\tThe pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets looked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the  numbers that counted: goals. \\tVancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to  boost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of Bautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals. \\tHowever, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the game to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second, checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged by a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early.  \\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score 2-1.  \\tDomi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush to the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do  anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were allowed to set up and make plays. \\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably. McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck zone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead. \\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The Jet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's legs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2. \\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off. This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight Winnipeg defence that were never supported. \\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive lapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff in the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with no Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the game up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a  backhand even though he was off balance.  \\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2. \\tNext game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games. - 30 -\",\n",

Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.

If they were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive abilities.   When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing  apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't  very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of him.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of player.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of players- this includes defensive forwards.  When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest defensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being a defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.

       " \"About 25 is correct for Numminen and Lumme.    No, Kurri's points are too low. 27 for Kurri and 28 for Sel{nne.     That's true. Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame- ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better  skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many  breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen.  I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans are in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the class of his own).\",\n",

       " \"The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.       The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.         The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck. I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.         So far so good!\",\n",

But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).  \\tOn another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter. \\tFernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good.

Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city.

       " 'Wow, this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team, Boston. Which Sweeney you ask...well, of course Bob Sweeney, the one that Boston let Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing).  Game winner in OT in game 1, and another BIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why Grant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countered a minute later, but hadn\\'t this course of Buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I think Boston would have notched their first win of the series.  Well, the Sabres haven\\'t made it to the end of this series yet, but I certainly feel they\\'ve got Boston right were they want them...actually, they\\'ve got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt that would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more heroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I think Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging a new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I\\'m not gonna waiger anything on this, because I\\'ve seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey.  Talking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev deflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a tesiment to Buffalo\\'s ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end (something they weren\\'t necessarily in the regular season).  The Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in the opening seconds.  I don\\'t normally like penalties being called in such ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres won a faceoff (they weren\\'t that hot in this dept the rest of the game) when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his shot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting it up.  I didn\\'t realize it went in until the announcer started screaming, \"They score, THEY SCORE!!!\".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping up and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating over to Brad May who he jumped on.',\n",

I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:   I think at this point there\\'s a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murray\\'s logical thought.  As outsiders, it\\'s fine for  us to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we\\'re all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he\\'ll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we\\'ll see how good of a GM he really is.   I may not agree with everything you\\'ve said, but it\\'s been fun discussing it with you.',\n",

To put it another way, compared to an average third baseman last year:  Boggs converted 11 more grounders into outs, turned 2 more double plays, and prevented 11 doubles.  Hayes let 12 more grounders go by for hits, turned 6 more double plays, and prevented 4 doubles. --  Dale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic\",\n",
       " 'Um, surely you didn\\'t intend to compare the \\'93 Reds with the 29 Philidelphia A\\'s.  The Yankees were finishing 2nd to a team that was as good as the 26-28 Yankees, while the Yankees had aged some from their peak years.  Ruth and Gehrig couldn\\'t play every position simultaneously.  IMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season, that the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Reds have slightly passed their peak.  Also, if you\\'re going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriate comparison to the \\'93 Braves might be the \\'23 Yankees.   After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series,  both teams won/will win the Series this year, despite the heroics of some old fart on the other team.

       " \"Lloyd Pettit.   Yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much  less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the last three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than  $50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.  Pettit gambled and lost. Now he'll have to pay more.\",\n",

Sure, if a man is tired and needs real rest, then taking a break might be a constructive act.  Perhaps if a man is mentally \"strained\", then sitting him down might help to the extent that that helps him relax.

Just looking at his hitting record, he\\'s had 2 seasons of OPS greater than .800, which is pretty good for an OF.  His 1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to third base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF, he began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.  But no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye over the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding, he was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came up through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through 2 position changes in the space of a year.  He\\'s an adequate OF, although not great, and at least some of your perception of his fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the ML level.  (I know you\\'re another long-term Braves fan :)  About playing 3B...IMO, that\\'s the 2nd most DIFFICULT position to field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and  speed, but at 3B, you\\'ve got to have quick reflexes and have  a GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when playing sandlot softball!  Granted, I\\'d still put my best overall infielder at SS, but that\\'s because he gets more chances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me that so many teams have tried to convert other position players to 3B.  But maybe that\\'s because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is scarce.  Finally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to perform well, and works hard to improve.  You don\\'t get those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a lot of weight work.  Now, whether he\\'s been overdoing it these days may be a valid question, as is the question of whether he tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat. But frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential, I\\'d much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not trying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation to an adult; but at that age I don\\'t believe you can teach hustle.  All that said, I don\\'t think I\\'d sign Gant to another long-term contract.  He\\'s 28 now, and I think he\\'s free-agent eligible in 2 years, when he\\'ll be 30.  Given his career curve and limitations, I wouldn\\'t expect him to last much past 35 as a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta\\'s got some talent on the farm, and I\\'d rather take my chances down the road with Nieves et al.',\n",

The Jets haven't lost to the Flames in '93.  They will, but it will be a close series that will come down to how well Roberts has recovered.

However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?  Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays) Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs. Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.  Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays). Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs. Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.  Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a  different SS.  Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall. --  Dale J.

       " 'I am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here.   If  you asked  somone,  who  had never heard of hockey before, if LA played in the Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be? What  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division?  The naming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary obfuscation.    Hardly.  The \"established\" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al. The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop- olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth- er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de- bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe and his pals showed up.   What\\'s wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better defenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?  And if you think that Bruce Norris\\' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby Orr\\'s  then,  in the interests of education, why don\\'t you take a poll and find out how many people know who Norris was?  But you don\\'t  have to, do you?   So you don\\'t feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember that  Vancouver  plays in the West division?

Quoting me out of context does more to erode your credibility than it  does  mine.   My  position  is clearly  progressive  and  is anything but \"biased, closed minded, ig- norant\".

I have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the ESPN crowd ( and other announcers ) bitching about it.  I have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and shouting \"Hurry up!\"  If I cough up big bucks for a  ticket, I don\\'t mind a game that last more than 2:10.  I really don\\'t understand it.    \\tGames are longer now for several reasons:  more pitching changes, more basestealing ( and throws to first ), etc...I think a very small factor is the increased time it takes Jose Canseco/ Deion Sanders/ [insert fancy showboat ballplayer here] to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the batter\\'s box.  My impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this an issue because they like shorter games - they get to head back to hotel bar, eat steaks, get drunk, tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase stewardesses around the bar.  Sure they want the game over with.  Print  journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games: they have deadlines.

Leeman wouldn\\'t take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn\\'t take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.

I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET, especially for those in the East Coast who can't get final scores for West Coast games in their newspapers or late TV newscasts. This is helpful to fans in other countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. Also, many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only available through BBS's or some pay news services. By the way, mine is free of charge and has no copyright restrictions.   Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. Other than that, everything is done through private e-mail. Currently, there are 986 people on my mailing list that branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. And the list grows by an average of 35 people a day.  If people on USENET really don't want to see the postings I do to rec.sport.baseball on a daily basis, please just let me know.

However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and : Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and : delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is : a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.    IMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at  this time. Johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his  group of players. I would say we have been very lucky here in  Pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one.  (Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the  change.) With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this  year, a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check. Johnson on the  other hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players  to new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both  of which came at exactly the right time.   Another person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach  for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. How can  you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway?  Playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also  keeps the egos in check.   Just a couple of ideas.\",\n",

I don\\'t remember why they said that it did not work.  Anyone remember this?  Jody McDonnel on WIP in Phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was inevitable.  How would a pitch clock work on throws to first?  Another pair of suggestions: 1. Remove the Balk rule.  It is the runners responsibility to stay \"safe\"    no matter what the pitcher does.  2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5)    without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base    as if walked.  The no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  The base-walk allows the runner to \"challenge\" pitcher to throw over to the base.   I too, find myself surfing when I know that it will be enough time between each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his \"jewlery\".',\n",

       " \"There are several reasons for this difference.  The main reason is that good hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull) are rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a place to put aging veterans.  Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they did during the rest of the season.  A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first or the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason.  Reggie Jackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he hit like the old Reggie when he was in right.  The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60 at DH will count only in the right fielders' averages.   This makes sense; you might also look at it another way.  Although the *average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left fielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly lower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job anywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH.\",\n",

I hear the FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when they played golden oldies) because you can't avoid it.  Of those three, WIP has the best hosts hands down.  Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer, and neither is Jody Mac.  WTEM is too generic to be placed in the catergory.

One of the main problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players to be shown between plays.

I think batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are interesting because they\\'re attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.  One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its open-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it\\'s going to go on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed, and some games are slow and lazy.  That\\'s fine by me.

I think Stawberry, Lasorda and the various media types should sit and watch the replay then apologize to the fan.   Darryl has not gotten off to a good start, he has to blame someone.   As long as the fan doesn\\'t interfere with the play I see no problems.',\n",

The New York Football Giants had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee Stadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea. When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using the new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the Cosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing with the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.   I'm under the impression that when Murph says it, he means it!  As a regular goer to Shea, it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and renovated the place.

The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees all disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.  The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn\\'t have surprised anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn\\'t deserve the 22-33 record in June.  The White Sox and A\\'s upped their game a bit, while the Twins dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.
