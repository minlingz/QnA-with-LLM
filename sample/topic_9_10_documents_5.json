        "text": "\n\nI am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack\nof any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\nregular season game.          PENS RULE!!!\n\n",

        "text": "\n[stuff deleted]\n\nOk, here's the solution to your problem.  Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able\nto watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC), \nBUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if\neach series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd\nconsecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).\n\nI have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE\nand keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two\nafternoon games.\n\nBtw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed\nto know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore\nand they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.\n\n",

I don't know!\n\nAs for the picks\nOttawa picks #1 which means it is almost 100% that Alexander Daigle will \ngo #1. He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec.  IMO I would\ntake Kariya.
